## üìù Description

Trade is a native iOS app built with Swift and SwiftUI, designed for real-time cryptocurrency tracking. 
It provides live price updates, interactive charts, trade history, and order book data. Users can save favorite currencies, create watchlists, set notifications, and customize the interface for a personalized experience.


## ‚öΩÔ∏è Projects goals

The objective was to develop a native mobile application specifically for iOS, enabling users to efficiently monitor real-time cryptocurrency prices. The design was inspired by Apple‚Äôs stock app, which serves a similar function for traditional stocks. The aim was to create a more intuitive and user-friendly alternative to the often complex interfaces of cryptocurrency exchange platforms.

## üöÄ Features

A core functionality of the app is providing real-time exchange rates for various cryptocurrency pairs. The Markets screen displays a comprehensive list of tradeable pairs available on the Poloniex exchange, with data retrieved via its API.

Users can organize the list by sorting pairs based on price, name, or daily percentage change. A search option is also available, making it easier to locate specific trading pairs.

Beyond the general market list, the app includes a watchlist feature that enables users to save their preferred pairs. Additionally, they can create multiple lists and set a default one to appear on the home screen upon launching the app.

Another key feature is the Pair Details section, which provides an overview of each pair‚Äôs performance. It displays essential data, including the latest price, daily percentage change, price charts, recent trades, and the order book.

For visual representation, the app offers three types of charts: area, line, and candlestick. Users can customize the time range displayed, with options ranging from all-time data to specific intervals such as 10, 5, 2, or 1 year, as well as 6, 3, or 1 month, a week, a day, an hour, or 30 minutes.

Within the Pair Details view, users can toggle between the recent trade history and the order book. Buy and sell orders are color-coded for easy differentiation.

Lastly, the Settings menu provides customization options, including theme selection (light, dark, or system default), the ability to enable or disable notifications and sounds, and language preferences.
